without any instructions, a processor will not fail

specify a particular type of failure (see FailTypes enums) by calling
failX=FailType.YYY
where X is the processor number and YYY is the type

counterX=Y
specifies the number of particular instances until the process actually fails.  default = 1
 
messageX=MessageType.YYY
default = every message (except heartbeat) is counted for failure

targetX=Y
the recipient or sender of the message
default = messages from/to everyone count

includeX=A,B,C
for the PARTIAL_BROADCAST failure only, designates which processes to send to before failing
default = send to all processes, then fail
if you want it to send to nothing then fail, specify an empty one: includeX=

stateX=TransactionState.YYY
not yet implemented in Process
